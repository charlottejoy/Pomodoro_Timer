# FreeCodeCamp Pomodoro Timer

## User stories:
* I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
* I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
* I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

## Nice to haves:
* Change colour as time elapses?
* Set a random quote?

Both of these exist in other versions I've created, so this is a good opportunity to practice adding different parts together.
